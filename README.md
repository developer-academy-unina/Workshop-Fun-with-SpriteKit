## About

Project template for the workshop Fun with SpriteKit, where people use it as the baseline to implement a SpriteKit arcade game using the tools SpriteKit has to offer.

You should have some preliminary knowledge about SpriteKit to be able to go through this activity.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Workshop-Fun-with-SpriteKit
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

This project is at the core of the activity and is used to complete all the steps demonstrated in it.

The template is super simple and provides:
* Three different states: Main Menu, Playing and Game Over
* Customizable screen for instructions
* Game Logic layer separated from the Game Scene
* Scoring system by points and time

**How to use the template**

The template is fully commented to guide you while creating your own arcade game prototype.

* Fully customize the interfaces using SwiftUI
* Write your Game Logic separate from your Game Scene
* Take advantage of all SpriteKit has to offer in your Game Scene
